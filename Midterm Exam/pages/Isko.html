                <h1 class="about">Isko Moreno</h1>
                <p class="info">Francisco Moreno Domagoso (born October 24, 1974), also known by his stage name Isko Moreno, is a Filipino politician and actor currently serving as the 22nd mayor of Manila since 2019. Before heading the capital of the Philippines, he first gained notability as an actor and television personality. He entered politics in 1998, and ran for city councilor and was elected for three consecutive terms. In 2007, he ran as vice mayor of Manila and was elected for three consecutive terms. In 2016, He was term-limited as vice mayor and unsuccessfully ran for senator in the 2016 senatorial elections. He placed 16th out of 50 candidates. He then served in the Duterte cabinet as social welfare undersecretary for a few months in 2018 before running and being elected mayor of Manila in a landslide victory against his former allies Joseph Estrada and Alfredo Lim in the 2019 local elections.

                    Moreno has described his leadership style as akin to that of his predecessor Alfredo Lim, citing their shared commitment in reducing crime and maintaining cleanliness of the capital. Moreno is also noted for his streetwise public image due to his use of colorful language coupled with Manila street slang. As a result, he was catapulted into prominence and is colloquially referred to as Yorme.
                    
                    On September 22, 2021, Moreno announced his bid for the Philippine presidency in the 2022 election.</p>

                <h1 class="career">Political Career</h1>
                <p class="CareerInfo">Moreno started his political career when he was elected and sworn in as councilor for Manila's first legislative district in 1998. He was re-elected in 2001 and 2004. His mentor, Vice Mayor Danilo Lacuna, encouraged him to study while fulfilling his duties. In 2003, Moreno obtained his business administration degree from the International Academy of Management and Economics in Makati. He also took a crash course in Local Legislation and Local Finance at the National College of Public Administration and Governance, University of the Philippines Diliman. He then studied public administration at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (University of the City of Manila). He also attended non-degree programs, fellowships, and short courses in leadership and governance at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University (Executive Education Program), and at the Saïd Business School, University of Oxford (Strategic Leadership Programme).
                    After his third and final term as city councilor, Moreno ran for vice mayor in 2007 under Asenso Manileño, as the running mate of outgoing vice mayor Danilo Lacuna. During his election campaign, he criticized what he called "black propaganda" by opponents, but did not pursue any charges. Moreno eventually won the elections, beating his closest rival by about 80,000 votes; however, Lacuna lost to Senator Alfredo Lim, a former mayor himself. He was re-elected in 2010, this time under Nacionalista Party and as the running mate of incumbent Mayor Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party. In 2015, Moreno announced that he would run for senator of the Philippines in 2016. He was named to the senatorial slate of presidential candidate and Senator Grace Poe's Partido Galing at Puso coalition and as an adopted senatorial candidate of Senator Bongbong Marcos, who was then running for vice president. He lost in his bid, placing 16th overall.Moreno currently serves as the mayor of Manila, beginning his tenure in 2019. In the local elections, he garnered a historic win by defeating both his predecessors Alfredo Lim and incumbent mayor Joseph Estrada.

                    Moreno was chosen as “Man of the Year in Public Service” of the Asia Leaders Awards 2019 and 2020. In November 2019, Moreno earned the 2019 Gusi Peace Prize as a recognition for his work in "consistently creating positive changes" from the time he was vice mayor and councilor. Also in 2019, Moreno was listed as one of the "Men Who Matter" that year by PeopleAsia Magazine. Additionally, Moreno was awarded as one of PeopleAsia Magazine's "People of the Year" 2020 and 2022.
