            <p style="color: white; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;">The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (internationally titled The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro) is a 2014 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. The film was directed by Marc Webb and produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach. It is the fifth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), and the final film in The Amazing Spider-Man series. The studio hired James Vanderbilt to write the screenplay and Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci to rewrite it. The film stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, Colm Feore, Paul Giamatti, and Sally Field. In the film, Peter Parker tries to protect Gwen Stacy as he investigates his parents' death, while also dealing with the supervillain Electro and the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn, who is dying from a deadly genetic disease.</br></br>

                Development of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 began after the success of The Amazing Spider-Man. DeHaan, Giamatti, Felicity Jones, and Chris Cooper were cast between December 2012 and February 2013. Filming took place in New York City from February to June 2013. The film was released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D on May 2, 2014, in the United States with two international premieres being held between March 31 and April 10 of that year. It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, with praise for the special effects, chemistry between Stone and Garfield, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score, although the script and length received criticism. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon / Electro was polarizing. It grossed $709 million worldwide, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2014, but the lowest-grossing live-action Spider-Man film to date.</br></br>
                
                The Amazing Spider-Man series was originally intended to continue with two sequels and several spin-offs, most notably films centered on Venom and the Sinister Six. Due to the film's mixed critical reviews and franchise-low box office performance, all subsequent installments were canceled and a new iteration of the character, portrayed by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), beginning with Captain America: Civil War (2016). The planned spin-offs were re-purposed for a timeline separate from The Amazing Spider-Man continuity and the MCU, beginning with Venom (2018). Both Garfield and Foxx reprise their roles as Spider-Man and Electro respectively in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), which follows the events of the film and which dealt with the concept of the multiverse and linked the film to the Raimi and Watts franchises.</br></br></p>
