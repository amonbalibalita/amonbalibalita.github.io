It is the first of a two-part sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and is set in a shared multiverse of alternate universes called the "Spider-Verse". The film is directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson from a screenplay by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and David Callaham. Shameik Moore voices Morales, starring alongside Oscar Isaac, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, and Issa Rae.</br></br>

                Sony began developing Across the Spider-Verse before Into the Spider-Verse's release in 2018, with the writing and directing team attached. It was set to focus on the relationship between Morales and Steinfeld's Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman. The film was officially announced in November 2019, animation work began in June 2020, and the title was revealed in December 2021.</br></br>
                
                Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) is scheduled to be released in the United States on October 7, 2022, delayed from an initial April 2022 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Part Two is expected to be released in 2023, and a female-focused spin-off film is also in development.</br></br></p>
