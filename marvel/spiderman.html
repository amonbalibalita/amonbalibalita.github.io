            <p style="color: white; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;">Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character
                 of the same name. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in the 
                 Spider-Man trilogy, and stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst,
                  James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origins and early superhero
                   career. After being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, outcast teen genius Peter Parker develops spider-like 
                   superhuman abilities, and adopts a masked identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City; facing the villainous 
                   Green Goblin in the process.</br></br> Development on a live-action Spider-Man film began in the 1980s. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, 
                   James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in 
                   development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was 
                   licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on all 
                   previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the 
                   multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, 
                   and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit
                    in final billing. Directors Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Michael Bay, Jan de Bont, M. Night
                 Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000.
                  The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent 
                  during production. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January to June 2001. Sony Pictures Imageworks
                   handled the film's visual effects.</br></br> Spider-Man premiered at the Mann Village Theater on April 29, 2002,
                    and was released in the United States four days later on May 3 2002. The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics. 
                    It was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend as well as the most successful film based on
                 a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $825 million worldwide, it was the third highest-grossing
                  film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film and the sixth highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. 
                  Spider-Man is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster. After its success, 
                  the film spawned two sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, released in 2004 and 2007 respectively. Maguire and Dafoe later 
                  reprised their roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), which dealt with the concept of a 
                  multiverse and linked the Raimi franchise to the MCU.</p>
